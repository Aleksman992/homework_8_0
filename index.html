          <h1 class="experiment__title">Vin Diesel</h1>
          <div class="experiment__blok">
            <p>Mark Sinclair (born July 18, 1967), known professionally as Vin Diesel, is an American actor. One of the world's
            highest-grossing actors, he is best known for playing Dominic Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise.</p>
            <p>Diesel began auditioning for roles in the early 1990s but struggled to gain roles and instead decided to make his own
            low-budget film. In 1995, he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the short film Multi-Facial. In 1997, Diesel made
            his first feature length film Strays, which he also wrote, produced and directed. Director Steven Spielberg took notice
            of Diesel after seeing him in Multi-Facial and cast him in a small role for his 1998 war epic Saving Private Ryan.
            Diesel subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999) while gaining a reputation as an action star
            after headlining the Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick franchises.</p>
            <p>Diesel portrays Groot in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero films, appearing in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019), Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). He also portrayed Groot in the animated film Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018) and the Disney+ animated shorts series I Am Groot (2022). Diesel has also earned commercial success in other genres, such as in the comedy The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised. Diesel portrayed Bloodshot in its 2020 superhero film adaptation, and is slated to appear in the upcoming Avatar films.</p>

          <h2 class="experiment__cap">Early life</h2>
          <div class="experiment__text">
            <p>Diesel was born Mark Sinclair[1] on July 18, 1967,[2] in Alameda County, California, where his mother was also born,
            though later moved to New York City with his fraternal twin brother, Paul.[3][4] His mother, Delora Sherleen Vincent
            (née Sinclair), is an astrologer.[5] He was raised by his white mother and adoptive African-American father, Irving H.
            Vincent, an acting instructor and theater manager.[4][6][7] Diesel has stated that he is "of ambiguous ethnicity."[8]
            His mother has English, German, and Scottish roots.[9] He has never met his biological father, and has said that "all I
            know from my mother is that I have connections to many different cultures";[10] Diesel believes that his parents'
            relationship would have been illegal in parts of the United States due to anti-miscegenation laws.[11]</p>
            <p>Diesel made his stage debut at age seven when he appeared in the children's play Dinosaur Door, written by Barbara
            Garson. The play was produced at Theater for the New City in New York's Greenwich Village. His involvement in the play
            came about when he, his brother and some friends had broken into the Theater for the New City space on Jane Street with
            the intent to vandalize it. They were confronted by the theater's artistic director, Crystal Field, who offered them
            roles in the upcoming show instead of calling the police.[12][13][14] Diesel remained involved with the theater
            throughout adolescence, going on to attend NYC's Hunter College, where studies in creative writing led him to begin
            screenwriting. He has identified himself as a "multi-faceted" actor.[15] Sinclair began going by his stage name Vin
            Diesel while working as a bouncer at the New York nightclub Tunnel, wanting a tougher sounding name for his occupation.
            Vin comes from his mother's married last name Vincent, while the surname Diesel came from his friends due to his
            tendency to be energetic.[16]</p>
            <p>Diesel's first film role was a brief uncredited appearance in the drama film Awakenings in 1990. After several years of
            struggle to gain acting roles, Diesel decided to make his own short film to secure funds for his feature film debut. In
            1994, he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the short drama film Multi-Facial, a semi-autobiographical film which
            follows a struggling multiracial actor stuck in the audition process. The film was selected for screening at the 1995
            Cannes Festival. As well as acting, Vin Diesel supported himself by working as a bouncer and telemarketer selling
            lightbulbs.[17]</p>
            <p>In 1997, Diesel secured funds to make his first feature-length film, Strays, an urban drama in which he played a gang
            leader whose love for a woman inspires him to try to change his ways. Written, directed, and produced by Diesel, the
            film was selected for competition at the 1997 Sundance Festival, leading to an MTV deal to turn it into a series which
            never came to fruition. Director Steven Spielberg took notice of Diesel after seeing him in Multi-Facial[18] and cast
            him in a small role as a soldier in his 1998 Oscar-winning war film Saving Private Ryan. This marked Diesel’s first
            major Hollywood film role. In 1999, he provided the voice of the title character in the animated film The Iron
            Giant.[19]</p>
